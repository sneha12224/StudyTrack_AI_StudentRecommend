##  Clustering and Pattern Detection Report

## Objective
Perform behavior clustering and pattern detection on student study habit data to identify distinct student groups based on their learning behaviors and academic performance metrics, forming the foundation for a personalized AI-based study habit recommendation system.

## Dataset Source
Synthetic student dataset with 300 records and 7 behavioral metrics.

## Steps Followed
1. Data preparation and feature selection
2. PCA for dimensionality reduction  
3. K-Means clustering (k=4)
4. Visualization and pattern analysis

## Tools Used
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Google Colab

## Key Insights
- 4 distinct student clusters identified
- Study hours strongly correlate with academic performance (r=0.72)
- Each cluster shows unique behavioral patterns

##  Conclusion
The clustering analysis successfully identified four distinct student behavior patterns with clear academic implications. The visualizations provide actionable insights for developing personalized study recommendations. The strong separation between clusters and meaningful behavioral patterns validate the approach for building an effective AI-based student recommendation system.
